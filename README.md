#Intertet of Things (IOT)
--
This is the larger scale concept of having all devices we have as consumers and business' under one big roof called the internet. For most of us, this is an exciting concept because it does create the possibility for new technologies. These new technologies can provide entertainment, but more importantly create more effeicient ways of carrying out operations

1. This also leads to more stress for everyone involved as well
	- The more ways people connect to the internet, the more opportunities are created for people to be taken advantage of
	- Security has and will always be the most important part of this concept
	- More opportunities to inform the public of risks

2. Another major topic is the amount of data coming through.

What this all means is that there are more jobs for us as developers but also adds more pressure to make sure we do protect the people who use our products.
